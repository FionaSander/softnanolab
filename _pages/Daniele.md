## Projects and Research
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size:90%" align="justify"> 
<b> Monte Carlo Simulations of Multivalent Systems for Biomedical Applications </b> <br/>
Our main research aim is to develop, validate and implement theoretical and simulation frameworks for the study of multivalent interactions in the context of real-life applications. In particular we intend to achieve a more extensive and detailed description and understanding of real applications' conditions: a range of never-before investigated factors have been taken into account and their effect on the selective potential of multivalent interaction is being currently gauged. 

Most of our work focuses on DNA Coated Colloids (DNACCs) in a diagnostic application setting, but our main results are general and should be readily extendable to capture the behaviour of different multivalent systems. Our two main projects are focusing respectively: on the influence of colloidal shape on the adsorption profile of DNACC on a receptor-decorated surface; on the applicability of DNACCs amorphous phase transition as a recognition event in diagnostic devices. 

<b> Additional Research Projects </b> <br/>
In parallel with our main project we have and still are collaborating with other academic groups on secondary research projects. In particular:

- We have collaborated with members of the Kraft Lab from Leiden University on the development of a novel experimental protocol and a theoretical kinetics model for the adsorption of DNACCs. While our collaborators provided the experimental data we focused on the optimisation and computational implementation of a model to fit, analyse and interpret the data.

- We are currently collaborating with the Computational Soft Matter research group from Nanyang Technological University from Singapore on the development of a Deep Neural Network for a fast and reliable prediction of the kinetics of reaction-rate based systems. A possible application to DNA origami folding kinetics is being considered as final validation of the results.
