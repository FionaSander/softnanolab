## Current Projects and Research
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size:90%" align="justify">  <a href="https://fionasander.github.io/softnanolab/research/bioinspiredmaterials/">  <strong>Design principles for low-friction polymer brushes as a synthetic analogue of cartilage
</strong> </a> <br />  The articular cartilage found covering the ends of bones in the synovial joints of mammals exhibit exceptional tribological properties, giving a low friction response ($\mu$ = 0.001) even when subjected to normal loads exceeding 100 atm. The goal of this project is to use coarse-grained molecular dynamics in order to study the system focusing on the architecture of the polymers on the surface and thus provide rational design principles for cartilage analogues.  </p>
