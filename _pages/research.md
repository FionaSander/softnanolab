Our research focusses on soft matter nanotechnology related topics. Whereas the computational approaches are based on similar principles of statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics the topics range very broad.

Currently research is being carried out in following areas:

Influence of Structure on Clay Behaviour
Liquid crystal elastomers for molecular sensors
