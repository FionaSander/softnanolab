    title: "Dr. Stefano Angioletti-Uberti"
    excerpt: "Since 2016 Stefano is holding the position of Lecturer for Theory and Simulation of Materials at Imperial College London. He received his BSc and MSc in Materials Science from Universita' degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca in Milano and continued with a PhD at Imperial College London also in Materials Science. From 2010 to 2013 he then worked as a Research Asscoiate at Univeristy of Cambridge working on development of theory and simulations to describe DNA-coated colloids and their self-assembly. From 2013 to 2015 he got awarded an Alexander-vom-Humboldt Fellowship and worked at the Hemholtz Zentrum Berlin on the development of theoretical models for protein adsorption on nanoparticles and describtion of kinetic processes in nanoreactors. Since 2015 Stefano also holds a Professorship for Soft Matter at Beijing University of Chemical Technology."
