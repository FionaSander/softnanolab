## Current Projects and Research

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size:90%" align="justify">  <a href="https://fionasander.github.io/softnanolab/research/nanomedicine/">  <strong>Autonomous design and generation of 2D DNA origami nanostructures implemented alongside a coarse-grained simulation pipeline for DNA.
</strong> </a> <br />  DNA Origami exploits the ability of two DNA strands, containing complementary nucleotide sequences, to self-assemble into complex and arbitrary shapes with nanometer precision. By gaining a greater understanding of how DNA structures can be designed to detect specific sequences of DNA, we may be able to establish a novel biosensing method. During my masters project, the goal is to continue developing the <a href="https://github.com/softnanolab/drawNA/"><i>drawNA</i></a> software package, containing tools for the generation, simulation and analysis of DNA nanostructures. This will include writing algorithms to generate multiple DNA origami structures for a given 2D shape, integrating tools for coarse-grained DNA simulations and developing tools for high-throughput analysis.</p>
