## Current Projects and Research
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size:90%" align="justify">  <strong>Biosensing Capabilities of Plasmonic Systems</strong> <br /> The use of plasmonic materials for fluorescent biosensing has been exemplified countless times over the last two decades. Small improvements are made as new nano-fabrication techniques are implemented, but most support the same argument: Plasmonic metals increase fluorescent signals. As large scale manufacturing becomes more feasible and cost-effective, it is now crucial to determine which factors are necessary. The goal of this work is to use Fourier difference time domain (FDTD) and Green's Dyadic Function (GDF) modelling to predict the success of a given substrate on fluorescence enhancement. Modelled data is verified using patterned thin films, electron energy loss spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and flurophore conjugated AFM tips. Together a system is developed that can predict (i) deviations in biosensor concentration measurements, (ii) optimal positioning of flurophores, and (iii) possibilities for dual mode imaging. When used in combination with Bayesian statistics and optimisation algorithms, pivotal design questions can be answered that have so far been taken for granted. For example: Is the best approach for a plasmonic biosensor truly to reach the highest enhancement? Or does this result in large deviations that bring large errors into identifying a specific concentration? By addressing this problem now, before widespread implementation, research backed decisions can be made about the validity of individual structures as biosensors.    </p>
