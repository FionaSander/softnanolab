intro: 
  - excerpt: '<p style="text-align:justify;"> So-called <strong>"Soft Matter"</strong> encompasses a wide range of systems, from <strong>nanoparticles to proteins, from membranes to synthetic polymers</strong>. In general, soft materials are <strong>highly responsive</strong> and their behaviour can be tuned by changing their local environment. At the SoftNanoLab, we are interested in using <strong>a combination of theory, computer simulations and experiments</strong> to unravel the design principles that allow to obtain a specific response, tayloring it towards a specific application. From nanoparticles that can <strong>selectively deliver drugs only to specific targets</strong> to polymers-based <strong>biosensors that change colour upon the presence of certain molecules</strong> or <strong>glues for biological tissues</strong>, our group is willing to push the boundaries of materials science to discover the materials of tomorrow. <br /> <br />
