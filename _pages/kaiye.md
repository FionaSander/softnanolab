## Current Projects and Research
<p style="margin-left: 40px" align="justify">  <a href="https://fionasander.github.io/softnanolab/research/nanomedicine/"><strong>Simulation of nanocomposite bioadhesives</strong> </a> <br /> As their name suggests Liquid Crystal Elastomers combine properties of both liquid crystals and elastomers resulting in unique properties which offer possible application in fields ranging from soft robotics and medical applications to highly sensitive sensors. Liquid crystals show changes of optical properties even upon small changes in their environment which makes them highly relevant for use in sensors. In combination with elastomers completely new mechanical properties arise which enable mechanical actuation upon certain stimuli with neglectable energy cost amplyfying extremely small changes to a macroscopic level. This characteristic gives them high relevance for sensoring application.
  
  The research project is focussing on the use of stimuli-responsive polymers in combination with liquid crystals. In the literature only a small range of different polymers and combination of liquid crystal and polymer responsitivity has been investigated. Therefore the exploration of the use of responsive polymers in combination with liquid crystals is of high interest whereas a focus is laid upon molecular sensoring in order to detect specific molecules. This can be of high interest for example in analysis of water qualities in an easy, fast and affordable manner.  </p>
