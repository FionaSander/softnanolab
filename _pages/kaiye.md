## Current Projects and Research
<p style="margin-left: 40px" align="justify">  <a href="https://fionasander.github.io/softnanolab/research/nanomedicine/"><strong>Simulation of nanocomposite bioadhesives</strong> </a> <br /> Nanoparticles are being used as reinforcing agents to fabricate mechanically strong elastomers. A very few mixture of nanoparticles into the matrix is sufficient to significantly enhance tension and flexibility of the polymeric nanocomposites. It is a promising technique in biomedical applications such as bio-glues. My current research interest focuses on replacing hard nanoparticles in bio-glues with polymer colloids, which are regarded as soft nanoparticles, since they are more flexible and higher interaction surface area. We are using coarse-grain molecular dynamics to model the architectural effect of polymeric nanoparticles.  </p>
