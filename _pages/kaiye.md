## Current Projects and Research
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size:90%" align="justify">  <a href="https://fionasander.github.io/softnanolab/research/nanomedicine/"><strong>Simulation of nanocomposite bioadhesives</strong> </a> <br /> Nanoparticles are being used as reinforcing agents to fabricate mechanically strong elastomers. A very small percentage of nanoparticles incorporated into the matrix is sufficient to significantly enhance tensile strength and flexibility of the polymeric nanocomposites. Therefore these materials offer promising potential application in biomedical applications such as bio-glues. My current research interest focuses on replacing hard nanoparticles in bio-glues with polymer colloids. The latter are considered to be soft nanoparticles and display higher flexibility and larger interaction surfaces. For this we are using coarse-grain molecular dynamics to model the architectural effect of polymeric nanoparticles on the properties of nanocomposite bioadhesives.  </p>
