intro: 
  - excerpt: '<p style="text-align:justify;"> So-called "Soft Matter" encompasses a wide range of systems, from nanoparticles to proteins, from membranes to synthetic polymers. In general, soft materials are highly responsive and their behaviour can be tuned by changing their local environment. At the SoftNanoLab, we are interested in using a combination of theory, computer simulations and experiments to unravel the design principles that allow to obtain a specific response, tayloring it towards a specific application. From systems that can selectively deliver drugs only to specific targets to polymers-based biosensors that change colour upon the presence of certain molecules, from nanoreactors that can enhance specific reactions to polymers that can glue tissues together, our group is willing to push the boundaries of materials science to discover the materials of tomorrow. </p>'

# Dr Stefano Angioletti-Uberti
Lecturer in Theory and Simulation of Materials
## Current Projects and Research
My research group focuses in applying Statistical Mechanics and various numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations to study Soft Matter systems and their applications. Broadly speaking, the main aim is to understand how to tune a materials behaviour by coating it with different ligands, both of synthetic and biological origin. Among the various applications studied, important research themes are the self-assembly of functional structure exploiting ligand-receptor based interactions, catalysis in polymer-based Nanoreactors and nanoparticle and polymers for drug delivery and biosensing applications.
