### Clay

Clay is the most abundant type of soil on the Earthâ€™s surface.According to the British Geological Survey (2016), clay minerals constitute an estimated 16% of the total volume of soil.Unlike cohesionless materials, clay is challenging to study because the influence of structure (i.e. fabric and inter-particle forces) on its behaviour cannot be neglected. Several classificationsof fundamental clay fabrics, derived mainly from SEM images,are given intheliterature (Sides and Barden, 1970; Collins and McGown, 1974). The particular fabric observeddepends on the characteristics of the depositional environmentof clay, such as pore fluid chemistry andstrength of inter-particle forces. As noted by Atkinson (2007), the basic framework used to describe clay behaviour was developed by considering destructured, reconstituted samples of clay, whereno bonds are present between particles. By contrast, most natural soils have some structure and bonding. Experimental evidence of structure effects hasbeen shown(Figure 1)by several authors (e.g. Burland, 1990; Leroueil and Vaughan, 1990; Cotecchia and Chandler, 1997, 2000)by comparing the behaviour of natural (with structure) and equivalent reconstituted (without structure) clays.
