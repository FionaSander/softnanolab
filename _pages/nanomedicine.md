  <p style="font-size:80%; margin-left:40px"> Multivalency is the ability of certain molecular constructs to interact by forming multiple ligand-receptor bonds. This does not only increase the overall strength of the interaction, but more importantly provides a potential way to embed such construct with binding selectivity in different scenarios where classical, i.e. monovalent, drugs would not work, think for example chemotherapy. This research line is dedicated to i) Build and explore different statistical mechanical models as well as computational algorithms to generally describe multivalent interactions and ii) use such models to determine the optimal conditions for the design of multivalent binding constructs, in particular in terms of increasing the selectivity towards specific target. In this regard, we where recently able, in collaboration with the Battaglia group at UCL, to show that our modelling strategy can correctly describe the experimentally observed behaviour of ligand functionalised nanoparticles in binding different cancer cell lines. You can find the open source version of our paper <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Design_principles_for_precision_targeting/5647969">here:</a> </p> {% include feature_row id="feature_row" type= "center" %}

  <p style="font-size:80%; margin-left:40px"> Nanoparticles can be used as reinforcing agents in order to fabricate elastomers with enhanced mechanical properties while keeping a high flexibility. Promising potential applications can be found in biomedical applications such as bio-glues. Current research in our group focuses on replacing hard nanoparticles in bio-glues with polymer colloids which enable higher flexibility and larger interaction surfaces. For this we are using coarse-grain molecular dynamics to model the architectural effect of polymeric nanoparticles on the properties of nanocomposite bioadhesives.</p> {% include feature_row id="feature_row" type= "center" %}
