  <p style="font-size:80%; margin-left:40px"> Multivalency is the ability of certain molecular constructs to interact by forming multiple ligand-receptor bonds. This does not only increase the overall strength of the interaction, but more importantly provides a potential way to embed such construct with binding selectivity in different scenarios where classical, i.e. monovalent, drugs would not work, think for example chemotherapy. This research line is dedicated to i) Build and explore different statistical mechanical models as well as computational algorithms to generally describe multivalent interactions and ii) use such models to determine the optimal conditions for the design of multivalent binding constructs, in particular in terms of increasing the selectivity towards specific target. In this regard, we where recently able, in collaboration with the Battaglia group at UCL, to show that our modelling strategy can correctly describe the experimentally observed behaviour of ligand functionalised nanoparticles in binding different cancer cell lines. You can find the open source version of our paper under <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Design_principles_for_precision_targeting/5647969">this link.</a> </p> {% include feature_row id="feature_row2" type= "center" %}

  <p style="font-size:80%; margin-left:40px"> Nanoparticles can be used as reinforcing agents in order to fabricate elastomers with enhanced mechanical properties while keeping a high flexibility. Promising potential applications can be found in biomedical applications such as bio-glues. Current research in our group focuses on replacing hard nanoparticles in bio-glues with polymer colloids which enable higher flexibility and larger interaction surfaces. For this we are using coarse-grain molecular dynamics to model the architectural effect of polymeric nanoparticles on the properties of nanocomposite bioadhesives.</p> {% include feature_row id="feature_row" type= "center" %}

  <p style="font-size:80%; margin-left:40px"> DNA can be used as a barcode to identify the presence of specific organisms. For this reason, the ability to detect the presence of specific sequences with high selectivity is important for the development of diagnostic tools and in particular for the detection of both bacterial and viral infection. This research line is dedicated to the application of coarse-grained modelling and polymer physics principles for the design of such tools, and their experimental validation through collaborations with the experimental groups of Dr. Di Michele. </p>

  <p style="font-size:80%; margin-left:40px"> Cationic (star) polymer can be used to make complexes with DNA, shedding the latter from enzymes that would otherwise degrade it as well as helping shuttling it through the cellular membrane. In this project, we use coarse-grained simulations to determine the link between the architecture of these polymers and the formation of complexes with DNA, with the overall goal to understand how to tune such complexes for enhanced transfection efficiency, an important factor for all sorts of genetic therapies. </p>

  <p style="font-size:80%; margin-left:40px"> All around the world various types of hydrogels are being developed as carriers for drugs. In particular, hydrogels can be synthesised to have different degradation rates, important for the controlled released of drugs in the body that should match the ideal pharmacokinetics required for therapy. In this research line, our goal is to describe degradation as a chemical reaction and thus use concepts developed in the theoretical treatment of catalysis in solution to describe how the degradation process is affected by environmental and intrinsic parameters, e.g. the presence of different salt ions, the concentration and type of enzymes present and the overall pH, just to cite a few relevant examples. </p>
