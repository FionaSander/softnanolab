  <p style="font-size:80%; margin-left:40px"> The research project is focussing on the use of stimuli-responsive polymers in combination with liquid crystals. In the literature only a small range of different polymers and combination of liquid crystal and polymer responsitivity has been investigated. Therefore the exploration of the use of responsive polymers in combination with liquid crystals is of high interest whereas a focus is laid upon molecular sensoring in order to detect specific molecules. This can be of high interest for example in analysis of water qualities in an easy, fast and affordable manner. </p> {% include feature_row id="feature_row2" type= "center" %}

  <p style="font-size:80%; margin-left:40px"> The project aims to improve the understanding of the response of clay to applied loads and deformations by explicitly simulating the interactions between three-dimensional clay particles using the Molecular Dynamics (MD) technique. Clay is challenging to study because the influence of the structure including particle arrangement and inter-particle forces on its behaviour cannot be neglected like in cohesionless materials such as sand. In this project, clay particles are represented by flat ellipsoids interacting via the Gay-Berne (GB) potential which is a modified form of the Lennard-Jones potential for aspherical particles. </p>
