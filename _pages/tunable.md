* <p style="font-size:80%; margin-left:40px"> The research project is focussing on the use of stimuli-responsive polymers in combination with liquid crystals. In the literature only a small range of different polymers and combination of liquid crystal and polymer responsitivity has been investigated. Therefore the exploration of the use of responsive polymers in combination with liquid crystals is of high interest whereas a focus is laid upon molecular sensoring in order to detect specific molecules. This can be of high interest for example in analysis of water qualities in an easy, fast and affordable manner. </p>
