  <p style="font-size:80%; margin-left:40px"> Liquid crystal elastomers combine stimuli-responsivity of liquid crystals with the mechanical properties of elastomers resulting in unique opto-mechanical coupling phenomena and new mechanical properties. The research project is focussing on the use of stimuli-responsive polymers in combination with the already responsive liquid crystals in order to explore possible dual-responsivity and use of these materials for molecular sensoring.</p> {% include feature_row id="feature_row2" type= "center" %}

  <p style="font-size:80%; margin-left:40px"> The project aims to improve the understanding of the response of clay to applied loads and deformations by explicitly simulating the interactions between three-dimensional clay particles using the Molecular Dynamics (MD) technique. Clay is challenging to study because the influence of the structure including particle arrangement and inter-particle forces on its behaviour cannot be neglected like in cohesionless materials such as sand. In this project, clay particles are represented by flat ellipsoids interacting via the Gay-Berne (GB) potential which is a modified form of the Lennard-Jones potential for aspherical particles. </p>
